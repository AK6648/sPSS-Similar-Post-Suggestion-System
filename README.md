# sPSS-Similar-Post-Suggestion-System

Post Suggestion/Recommendation System

This Python project provides a collaborative filtering-based system for recommending similar posts to users. It analyzes user-post interactions (e.g., ratings, upvotes, likes) to identify patterns and suggest posts with similar characteristics.

Features:

Implements collaborative filtering techniques like user-based collaborative filtering or item-based collaborative filtering.
Processes user-post interaction data (can be adapted to different data formats).
Generates recommendations for a given post based on similarity scores.
Provides flexibility for customization (e.g., adjusting recommendation parameters).
Requirements:

Python 3.x (with recommended libraries listed below)
Necessary Python libraries (install using pip install <library_name>):
pandas (for data manipulation)
numpy (for numerical computations)
scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
(Optional) Additional libraries for specific data processing needs (e.g., scipy for matrix operations)
Installation:

Usage:

Prepare your user-post interaction data (ensure it's in a compatible format, such as a CSV or NumPy array). The data should represent interactions between users and posts, such as ratings, upvotes, likes, or other relevant signals.
Modify the data_path variable in the Python script (recommendation_system.py) to point to your prepared data.

Customization:

You can experiment with different collaborative filtering techniques by modifying the relevant sections in recommendation_system.py.
Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., neighborhood size, number of recommendations) within the code to fine-tune the recommendation system's performance.
Further Development:

Evaluate the system's performance using metrics like precision, recall, or NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain).
Implement additional features like hybrid recommendation methods (combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering).
Consider techniques for handling cold start problems (when there's limited data for new users or posts).
Disclaimer:

This project provides a starting point for building a basic post suggestion system. It's recommended to tailor it further based on your specific needs and data.

Additional Notes:

Feel free to replace the bracketed information with your project's specifics.
You might need to modify the data processing logic within the script (App.py) to accommodate your specific data format.
Consider incorporating error handling into your code to gracefully handle potential issues.
